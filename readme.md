# On Standalone Application Router using HTML5 Application Repository

## Diagram

![diagram](diagram.png)

## Description

This is an example of an HTML5 app that you maintain on a standalone application router in your own space in the Cloud Foundry environment. The app is deployed to the HTML Application Repository.


## Download and Installation
1. Download the source code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/SAP-samples/multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples
    cd multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples/standalone-approuter-html5-runtime
    ```
2. Build the project:
    ```
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
3. Deploy the project:
    ```
    cf deploy mta_archives/approuter_html5_1.0.0.mtar
    ```

If the deployment has been successful, you find the URL of the application router in the console output or you can print it on Unix-based systems with `cf app standaloneportalmta | awk '/^routes/ { print "https://"$2"/" }'`. It probably has the following structure: <https://[globalaccount-id]-dev-multi-cloud-html5-apps-samples.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com>.

## Configuration
You can replace the content of the `HTML5Module` folder with your own web app. Keep in mind that you also need to change the path to the default app if your web app has a different ID.

To change the path to the default app, edit the `welcomeFile` property in the [`xs-app.json`](router/xs-app.json) configuration file of the application router.
